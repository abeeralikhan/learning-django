- We can insert data into our models using django shell also
To activate django interactive shell:
+ python manage.py shell

- Now, import your models by referencing to the models.py files inside your component

+ Model.objects.all() --> To see list of inserted data
+ Model.create(field1=value1, field2=value2, ...) --> To insert new data into the model from shell

- We can put multiple constraints on each field

- Routing & URLS
When a render a html file, we use the render() method from the django.shortcuts library
render() method accepts three arguements

+ render(request, '/location.html', context_object)

- Templates
Templates is the folder where all of our html markup will be stored and accessed from
1) Create a new folder "Templates" in the root directory of your project (where manage.py is)
And, store your html files in it
2) Declare templates in the settings.py file
