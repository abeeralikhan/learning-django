- How to add a new function based path and a view?
First define a new path for example example/
Second, inside the views.py, create a new view that you want to redirect using this new path example/
Your new function inside the views.py file will take a request parameter, and it will return a response. That's how this cycle works.
    you request something, in return you get a response.
Lastly, inside the urlpatterns list, add a new path() element.
    First parameter inside the path() function takes your new path, in our example its example/
        For example, path('example/')
    Second parameter is your view, that is your function you've made in the views.py file
        For example, path('example/', views.example)
    Last parameter is name of the path. This is used in the case where your path is complicated, name is used to easily identify it
        For example, path('example/', views.example, name="example")
