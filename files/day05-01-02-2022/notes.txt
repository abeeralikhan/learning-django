- Templates folder
Template is the folder where all of our html markup will be stored and accessed from
1) Create a new folder "Templates" in the root directory of your project (where manage.py is)
And, store your html files in it
2) Declare templates in the settings.py file
    Insert the path to your templates' folder in the DIRS list
3) Now, use your template by just mentioning its file name and extension while rendering

- Attributes sharing

- Template Inheritance
We create a base template e.g base.html, and using it, we make other templates
or, in other words, we extend base.html, and make other templates on top of it.

- How do we perform template inheritance?
In the base.html file, we create a body section. That body section is replaced by other templates
Benefit, we don't need to create boilerplate again and again. We just need to create it for base.html
and, other templates will inherit it.

- Where is it most useful?
While making a navbar
Every page will be sharing the same navbar that is on the base page, or can overwrite if want
Note: We can create multiple blocks
Example:
{% block <name_of_the_block> %}
 // you send data to the base class from here
{% endblock <name_of_the_block> %}

- include template tag
We can include external templates in our current template.
We do this to avoid inheriting base class all the time
We can create independent html components and include in our current template

Example:
{% include "example_component.html" %}

Above code will interpolate external templates in your calling template
